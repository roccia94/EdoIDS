# EdoIDS
Intrusion detection system for Magento able to detect most threats in the OWASP TOP 10.
Coupled with the detection system is a prevention mechanism that offers protection in case of a real threat. 
This IDS system is easy to use and install and guarantees a heightened level of security.
It consists of a series of generic detection systems that can detect the injection of HTML or JavaScript code , detect keywords commonly used in SQL injections, attacks aimed at the filesystem and more, by use of  the strong filter rules present in the PHPIDS. 
In the application you also have more specific detectors for known security bugs in Magento, in order to avoid these vulnerabilities in applications that have not been updated or that are not secure from these bugs.
The possibility to customize the detection weights allows you to regulate the detection of threats based on your specific needs, thereby limiting the number of false positives.
